Step 1: Database Preparation
●	Ensure the SQL database (MySQL, SQL Server, etc.) is properly structured:
○	Sales Table: transaction_id, customer_id, product_id, sale_date, quantity, revenue.
○	Customer Table: customer_id, name, age, gender, region.
○	Product Table: product_id, product_name, category, price, supplier.
●	Apply indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g.,
sale_date, customer_id, product_id) for
performance.
Step 2: Establish Connection in Tableau
●	Open Tableau → Connect to Server → choose SQL database type.
●	Enter server details, database name, and credentials.
●	Test connection to confirm access.
Step 3: Choose Connection Type
●	Live Connection: Direct queries to SQL for real-time updates.
●	Extracts: Pull data into Tableau’s Hyper engine for faster performance (schedule refreshes if needed).
Step 4: Data Modeling in Tableau
●	Import tables and define relationships:
○	Sales.customer_id →
Customers.customer_id
○	Sales.product_id →
Products.product_id
●	Use Joins or Relationships depending on analysis needs.
●	Create calculated fields (e.g., profit margin, average order value).
Step 5: Dashboard Design
●	Sales Trends: Line chart showing revenue over time.
●	Customer Demographics: Bar chart for age groups, pie chart for gender distribution.
●	Product Performance: Top-selling products, category-wise sales, profit analysis.
●	Add filters and parameters for region, product category, and time period.
Step 6: Optimization
●	Use SQL Views for pre-aggregated data (e.g., monthly sales totals).
●	Apply row-level security for sensitive customer data.
●	Tune queries and indexes to avoid slow dashboard performance.
